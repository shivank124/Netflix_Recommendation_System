# Netflix_Recommendation_System  
1. To recommend top-rated movies to users, I was dealing with movies and ratings dataset. The user-based recommendation helps to find similarities between user behavior.   
2. By setting a threshold value for movies and ratings reduced the less import data from the dataset.  
3. Singular value decomposition helps to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of dataset, we can get a basic pattern of data through SVD.  
4. By using this pattern we can recommend top-rated movies to users.
